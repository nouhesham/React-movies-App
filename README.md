 <h2>React-movies-App</h2>
This is a responsive react movie App using TMDB Api
<p>I have used the following :</p>
<p>1-usestate:which is a local state managment specified for each component</p>
<p>2-redux:which is a global state managment library to be able to dispatch the movies method</p>
<p>3-Axios instead of fetch because it can be used in  cancelling request and request timeout, and also Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP request</p>
<p>4-React progress bar for the movie rating</p>
<p>5-React bootstrap and fontawesome libraries </p>
